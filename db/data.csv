FIFA 22,"Powered by Football™, EA SPORTS™ FIFA 22 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S moves the game forward with groundbreaking next-gen HyperMotion gameplay technology that elevates every moment on the pitch. HyperMotion integrates advanced full-team mocap data and machine learning to heighten gameplay in every match in FIFA 22, harnessing the power of next generation consoles to deliver the most realistic, responsive and fluid gameplay experience we’ve ever built. FIFA 22 brings a new season of innovation across every mode in the game; enjoy more consistency between the posts with a goalkeeper rewrite that brings more composure to the most important position on the pitch, live out your football dreams as you create and manage your custom club to glory in Career Mode, get rewarded for your flair with restyled gameplay in VOLTA FOOTBALL, welcome back football’s most memorable players as FIFA Ultimate Team™ Heroes, and feel the atmosphere of your next big game with the most immersive matchday experience ever seen in EA SPORTS FIFA. 
  
 GAMEPLAY HYPERMOTION GAMEPLAY TECHNOLOGY Brand new for EA SPORTS FIFA and on next generation consoles, HyperMotion combines two technologies for the first time ever, revolutionising football gameplay:  Advanced 11v11 Match Capture: Xsens suits enable motion capture from 22 professional footballers playing at high-intensity for the first time. This unprecedented volume of high-quality real-human movement data powers how both individuals and teams move across FIFA 22. Machine Learning: Our cutting-edge and proprietary machine learning algorithm learns from over 8.7 million frames of advanced match capture, then writes new animations in real time to create organic football realism across a variety of interactions on the pitch.  The result is a more realistic, responsive and fluid gameplay experience in every match across every mode of FIFA 22 on next generation consoles:  Full Team Authentic Motion  A fundamental leap forward, Xsens Suits were used to record data from all 22 players playing at high intensity for the first time ever. Data captured from every touch, tackle, sprint, and duel results in the biggest animation refresh in FIFA history, with 4000+ new animations added - over three times more than in FIFA 21 - raising the footballing intensity, responsiveness, and physicality of every player in the game to unlock the most true-to-life movement in EA SPORTS FIFA history.   ML - Flow   Our machine learning algorithm reinvents how animations work in sports video games, delivering greater fluidity and visual realism than ever before. Learning from more than 8.7 million frames from Advanced 11v11 Match Capture, the ML - Flow algorithm writes new animations in real-time, enabling players to better adjust their stride and running cadence on approach to the ball to control or strike it more smoothly.   Tactical A.I.  Driven by the power of the new generation of consoles, Tactical A.I. creates deeper intelligence across all 22 players; giving each individual footballer the ability to better understand their teammates’ and opponents’ formations and movement to create a new level of tactical realism. In attack players can now make up to 6x more decisions per second, resulting in better awareness of their surroundings, smarter runs in build-up play, and more speed in reacting to loose balls. Rewritten defensive AI means teams now operate more as a unit, retaining their shape to move across the pitch and cover vacant space.   Kinetic Air Battles   Enhanced two player interaction technology syncs player animations, creating greater realism and responsiveness as they jump to battle for the ball. See defenders and attackers push, pull, and jostle as they rise to meet crosses, clearances, and long passes, increasing quality in headed situations and creating cleaner outcomes as players fight to be first to the ball.   Composed Ball Control  Powered by the animation refresh, controlling the ball in FIFA 22 is more natural and fluid than ever before. Longer two-touch animations enable better control of aerial balls, more agility when trapping ground balls, and more strength in shielding situations to give you new ways to drive forward in attack.   Player Humanization  Powered by Advanced 11v11 Match Capture, new off-ball player animations and ambient behaviour help bring on-pitch characters to life. See opponents talk, point, and direct each other based on the action, along with updated intensity-based locomotion that matches players’ urgency to make FIFA more realistic and immersive than ever.    ADDITIONAL GAMEPLAY FEATURES  Goalkeeper Rewrite - A brand new goalkeeper system brings a new level of intelligence to the last line of defence, unlocking more reliable shot-stopping and smarter decision-making between the posts. In FIFA 22, goalkeeper positioning personality replicates the different styles of keepers throughout the game - to represent the lightning-fast reflexes of world-class shot stoppers.   True Ball Physics - Real-world data imported into FIFA 22 takes the game’s ball physics to a new level of realism. Tuned parameters including speed, swerve, air drag, air resistance, ground friction, and rolling friction mean every touch, trap, shot, volley, pass, and dribble will look, move, and fly like the real thing.   Explosive Sprint - A new gameplay mechanic that changes the dynamic of one-on-one situations, Explosive Sprint gives you more control over acceleration when dribbling or defending. Lure opponents in and choose when to unleash your full speed to get away from the defender as you drive your team forward in attack.   New Attacking Tactics - New Attacking Tactics give you more control over how you want your team to play. Set up your team with different styles in each half of the pitch: keep the ball in your half and explode into attack with fast build up in the opponent’s, play direct from box to box, or line up in your own unique style.  CAREER MODE Live out your football dreams in FIFA 22 Career Mode as you create a club and lead them from relegation candidates to global giants, and enjoy an overhauled Player Career experience that gives you more ways to progress, achieve, and immerse yourself in your Pro’s journey through the game.
